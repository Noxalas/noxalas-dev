# Noxalas' Dev Blog

## Description

A blog where I post updates about my current projects and tutorials, mostly in the [[Godot Engine]].

## About me

I'm a student studying Interactive Design in Norway. I spend my free time creating art and games, striving to make things that make me happy and that will inspire others to do the same.

I started this blog to document my ventures and to have a place to look back on, to see the eventual progress I have made.
