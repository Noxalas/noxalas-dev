## 2.0 How our project works

### 2.1 How to test it
To test our solution you can test the Figma prototype through this public link:
(insert link here)
Or alternatively, you can also access the offline Figma project file in our Github repository.

### 2.2 Onboarding
A very simple page where the user is introduced to the product with a banner, a catchy introductory one-liner and an enticing 'get started'-button.

### 2.3 Login
After proceeding, the user is able to log in by either using a personal account or one registered with Feide, opening up for additional functionality inside the application. In the prototype, we only focused on the teacher's side of the application and therefore, this is where you are forced to log-in using Feide to continue.

### 2.4 Landing page
The 'home' page of the application. Here, a teacher is able to look at their upcoming lessons as well as plan future ones. They can also get an overview of all their students and seek help or guidance with the app through the support page. 

### 2.5 Lesson creation
In this section the user can define the date & time of the lesson, the class this lesson applies to and the location.

#### 2.5.1 Group creation
The most complex page in our prototype in which the user can add and remove groups, rename them, assign students to them and choose the group representative.

#### 2.5.2 Recipe planner
Here, the teacher can look for recipes in the *Chew* database and get a clear overview of the difficulty of preparation and the dietary restrictions that may apply to the group members.

#### 2.5.3 Task delegation
Afterwards, they can use this page to assign tasks to the groups either doing so on an individual basis, or creating a single task sheet for all groups. 

#### 2.5.4 Summary
This page gives the teacher an overview of the necessary ingredients, tools and appliances for making the dishes they have selected for a lesson. This checklist can be referenced as needed and each item in the list can be crossed out, making it a perfect shopping list. In a finished product, it would be possible for the list to be printed out.

### 2.10 Student page
From the landing page the user can access an overview of all their students. Here they can search for specific students, filter them based on name, class, group or dietary restrictions and review their account stats and past exploits.

### 2.11 Group summary
On this page, a teacher can review the groups they have created and the dishes they will be making, edit the group members and manage the group's assigned tasks.

### 2.12 Support
By getting here from the landing page, a teacher can use the provided material to learn more about the application. In the prototype, one can press the frequently asked questions tab and check the curriculum pertaining to the 7th grade, and the competence they are expected to have after.
