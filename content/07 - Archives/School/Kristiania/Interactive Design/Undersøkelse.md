## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Project Background

My field is interactive design and game development, and I have personally noticed a small gap in the subject of software usability. On a purely subjective basis, I got worried about the decrease in more physical and tactile engagement with technology as I heard that many children in my old middle school started using tablets in education, and that most do not know how to type on a traditional keyboard. As Daniela Mejîa states in the Census story, “Tablet ownership in U.S. households with children was 22 percentage points higher than in households without children in 2021…” as well as “... one of the largest differences was for so-called tablets — wireless, notebook-sized computers with touchscreens.”.

  

I am fully aware of the transitional nature of technology and how fast things can change. I have experienced many of these transitions myself, but I still felt a certain degree of uneasiness due to how detached technology has become. My idea to tackle this uneasiness is to delve into the subject of diegesis in games and skeuomorphism in interface design, not to change where technology is already heading, but maybe discover some ideas and concepts that could make interacting with these technologies take advantage of concepts from the real world.

  

### 1.2 Diegesis

The concept of diegesis is used to determine if an element is or is not a part of the narrative. Therefore, in the context of video games, diegetic UI elements are often those that are inside of the 3D game space and narratively exist in the fictional game world. Diegesis is not exclusive to visual elements, where haptic and auditory ones could be defined as diegetic as well, but we will limit ourselves to exploring visuals only.

“The design space, and how different identified categories of UI elements fit into it.” ()

  

Diegetic design is most often used when a developer wants a higher degree of immersion and to facilitate a suspension of disbelief in the player. This is very useful for narrative games where the player’s immersion is of a high importance.

### 1.2 Originality and contribution to existing research

While previous papers have touched on diegetic design in games, I feel we have not fully explored the potential the concepts have to improve usability and readability of mobile applications and other non-game user interfaces. 

  

Skeuomorphism can also be an interesting subject to take into consideration, where it resides as a very hot topic among designers 

### 1.3 Research Aim and Objective

The objective of this proposal is to investigate if diegetic design principles could be applied to non-gaming related applications. 

  

The main proposed question is:

  

How can diegetic interface design in games inform design choices in non-game UI, and can it improve usability?

  

These sub-queries have been formulated to help answer the main query:

- What are the key elements of diegetic design in games?
    
- In what ways does diegetic design enhance user interaction?
    
- Are there examples of successful applications of diegetic design outside the gaming industry?
    

## 2.0 Discovering and Applying Existing Knowledge

  

### 2.1 Literature Review Plan

  

### 2.2 Database Selection

Keywords

- UI, user interface
    
- diegetic design, diegesis
    
- games, video games
    
- skeuomorphism
    

  

Boolean operators

- (UI OR user interface) AND (diegetic OR diegesis) AND (games OR video games)
    
- (UI OR user interface) AND (diegetic OR diegesis) AND (skeuomorphism*)
    

  

Out of the databases that were explored during the creation of this proposal, Google Scholar had the most relevant hits in the game-related studies, while IEEEXplore had higher success with web and mobile interface usability studies. Although one may argue GS is less reliable than other scholarly databases, it casts a wide net and is multidisciplinary, which is perfect for game-related papers, books or theses as these may be published in very niche databases.

### 2.3 Initial Results

The initial results show a varied assortment of theses, mostly focused on player immersion in FPS (First-Person Shooter) games and immersion. There are also papers about diegetic design in Virtual Reality.

## 3.0 Research Strategy

After discovering and applying existing knowledge, we have to assess the scope of our research, create a prototype and perform usability tests aimed at the target group explored in our personas.

  

### 3.1 Exploration of existing games with diegetic design

From personal experience, the games listed below can be used to explore diegetic design, as used in games.

  

#### 3.1.1 Outer Wilds

Outer Wilds, created by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive, is a space exploration game. Without delving into too much detail, the game is set in a miniature scale solar system where the player is given many tools for traversal and interaction with the game environment, but no definitive objective. The player is led by pure intrinsic motivation, only being pushed forward by curiosity.

An example of diegesis in this game are some of the many tools the player character is granted. One of these is a signalscope. A handheld telescope with a small disc satellite tacked on, hence the name signal(tele)scope. This tool can be pointed out into deep space to look for radio signals, where on certain channels, music can be heard.

  

Another example of diegesis, though this time in the actual interface of the game, is the player HUD (head-up display). The interface is a great example of a spatial interface that exists in the fictional game world. This can be inferred by the fact that this HUD only appears when the player character wears their spacesuit, and that early on in the game, an older prototype of the suit can be worn, with retro-styled UI elements. These are UI elements that are canonically seen by the player character, not just the player.

#### 3.1.2 Sea of Thieves

Sea of thieves is another great example of diegetic design. The game is set in a world full of magic and sea-faring pirates. The premise is that the world you and your crew inhabit is always full of other players. Every pirate would like to plunder any loot they might get ahold of, and so conflict and emergent gameplay stems from player interaction.

  

Heavy use of contextual HUD elements clears up the viewport of the game of any unneeded information. The player’s health is only shown when it is low, or while in combat.

  

All the other details lie in how the game uses physicality in its design. When you and your crew want to look at a map of the world and plan your next voyage, you do not press a button on the keyboard to open up a full-screen UI, but rather, you have to physically walk to your ship’s captain’s room and look at the map on the table. Although this map updates live, showing events and positions of ships, it is still spatially inside the world, and your crewmates can point toward objects and mark them to remember key locations.

#### 3.1.4 Note on the choice of games to study

While these games contain some examples of diegesis, the researcher may choose to include other examples if they so choose as these game choices are subjective.

  

## 3.2 Creation of a prototype interface

Based on our previous work and assessment of existing literature, we need to create a proof of concept working with the knowledge we have obtained on diegetic systems and skeuomorphic designs. I propose the creation of a mobile application where we split our implementation into two subsets, A and B. A will be a traditionally designed interface using contemporary methods and principles, while B will be an alternate interface using the concepts we have explored in the previous section.

### 3.3 Defining our target group

We should expect the target group to have a certain degree of technical proficiency, so they can give valuable feedback. 

### 3.2 Methodology

We can triangulate to obtain richer data by combining:

- Interviews with target groups.
    
- A/B usability test of both prototype versions
    

- The A/B usability tests are a great way to see if applying the design principles we discover actually increase usability of the interface or not. 
    

- SUS-score survey after usability tests
    

  

For the usability tests we can block out two groups of five subjects each, for a total of ten subjects. As Jakob Nielsen outlines in his 

  

By combining the insights from these we can gain a holistic understanding of both the qualitative and quantitative value of our prototype and confirm if our hypothesis is correct. We can continue applying this test method iteratively until we find a definitive answer to our problem, or completely reject the outcome.

  
  

A final survey at the end of a usability test can provide us with quantitative data which we can interpret to see if our diegetic prototype interface is objectively improving the user experience.

### 3.3 Data Collection

Ensuring ethical data collection is a high priority in a study like this one. I would propose giving subjects of the usability test 

### 3.4 Data Analysis

  

## 4.0 Evaluation

Due to my own experiences it may be hard for me to actually go through with this proposal, as I feel I might have a slight bias toward it succeeding. 

  

I hypothesize that a major pitfall of incorporating diegetic design principles into mobile interfaces, for example, might be brushed off due to the inherently higher development cost. As diegetic designs need to be thoroughly tested to ensure that the designs are understandable to a wide audience.
