# PRO202 Individual Reflection

**Name**: Nataniel Marek Wlosek
**Group**: Bordeaux (*Group number: 21*)

## What has been good about the group?
I really enjoyed the experience of working together with the others. Everyone engaged in discussions and consistently gave each other feedback. We managed risks like sickness very well and since the group was so effective we could often, very easily, cover for anyone not feeling too well. Everyone worked diligently, and I felt inspired to do my best as well. 

## What could have been better about the group?
There were a couple times where I did not feel completely 'heard' inside the group. I am a reserved person and it takes me a while to get acquainted enough to actively engage with other people, but there were cases when I managed to speak out about some issue we had, which I had experience with, and it felt like my advice was brushed off. 

An instance of this was when we worked in Figma and we all decided to use pages as an 'archive' to show the progress between each sprint. Problem is, when you copy components over from one page to the next, they become instances, and sometimes even main component duplicates occur. When I told the team that I had to waste a lot of time each sprint fixing these, I never got a proper response.

## Which aspects of the project were positives for you?
I had plenty positive experiences within the group. I got the possibility to share some of the knowledge I have from both my own work and the things I have learned from the 'Interactive Design' course. 

## What would you improve on in the next project?
Next time I would strive to set proper fundamental design goals in the very early stages of a project, and be more assertive about fixing issues immediately before they spiral out of control and affect the group's performance and effectiveness. 

## Anything else?
Only thing I would like to mention is that I personally really missed programming while working on this project. Even though I supported the idea of focusing hard on a mostly design-based prototype, I still felt a little disappointed that I could not use the knowledge and experience I have with system design and full-stack development.
