# Letter of motivation

My name is Nataniel Wlosek, and I am writing to express my interest in pursuing a master degree in Human-Computer Interaction at the Kristiania University College. This opportunity aligns perfectly with my background in IT, specialized in interactive design, as well as my passion for problem solving and the creation of innovative and user-friendly digital experiences.

My journey so far has been marked by a deep commitment to applying my knowledge through various practical projects, particularly in the realms of video game creation and web development. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also fueled my passion for continuous learning.

Throughout my previous education, I have cultivated a comprehensive set of design and technical skills. From understanding the nuances of user experience to implementing effective design principles, I have strived to create digital interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing to as many people as possible. My work in video game development has allowed me to experiment with designing for an interactive medium and to create engaging user interfaces, while my web development projects have provided me with practical insights into creating responsive and user-centric websites and applications.

I have always enjoyed creating designs that are not only visually appealing but also easy to understand and navigate. My goal has been to create accessible digital experiences that for a diverse audience, and I hope to learn and hone my skills even further to achieve some of my long-term goals.

I am eager to collaborate with peers and professionals who share my passion for design and technology. I think it would be a very fun and educational experience for all of us, furthering our knowledge together on the topics we will learn throughout the semesters.

In conclusion, I am excited about the possibility of expanding my knowledge and embarking on this educational journey. I am committed to leveraging my background in IT and interactive design, coupled with my passion for continuous learning, to become an even more proficient designer.

Sincerely,
Nataniel Marek Wlosek
