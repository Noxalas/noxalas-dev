My first post on this blog, and the start of an exciting new adventure!

I've always wanted to start writing, and after keeping up with daily notes consistently in my [[Obsidian]] vault, I decided it was about time to start my dream blog. 

The plan is simple. I will document any and all fun things I discover or learn throughout my development journey, and write about them here. I will most probably share lots of tutorials and how-tos, including scripts, most being in [[GDScript]]. Additionally, I want to use this blog to document my progress working on [[notes/Kaffestrig]], me and my girlfriend's dream game project.

Hopefully I will stick to this blog, and if you choose to read it, I hope you get something out of it. 

Thanks for reading!
