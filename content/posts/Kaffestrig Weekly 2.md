This week's update is tiny and a bit late because I was quite busy, but I still managed to get a tiny bit of work done!

Sadly, through trying to implement hands holding weapons, I found that most of my equipment & inventory backend needs quite a bit of reworking to give me the functionality I need. Though, I whipped up a small prototype of weapon switching, *and* they're granting their abilities to the player correctly, so that's great! The only problem is some of the wonkiness that comes from how I handle a character's equipment and the actual equipment 'targets' on the body (where it's holding a weapon, for example).

It's not all bad though! Even though development went on the backburner, I was still thinking of solutions and things the game needs for the MVP. I'll be working more on the game these next couple of weeks, so hopefully there'll be more to show in the next update!
