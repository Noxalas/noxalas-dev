Shokupan Recipe 

Ingredients 

Tangzhong: 
-35g bread flour 
-175g water 

Milk Bread: 
-340g bread flour 
-3g salt 
-50g sugar 
-5g active dry yeast 
-40g egg white (around 1 egg) (optional: keep the yolk for your eggwash)
-140g whole milk, lukewarm 
-155g tangzhong 
-40g unsalted butter, softened 

To make the tangzhong, combine the flour and water in a small saucepan. Cook for 3-5 mins on medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened into a paste. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside to cool. 

Slightly warm up the milk in a small pot or microwave, then whisk in the egg white. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar and yeast. Pour in the milk mixture and the tangzhong and mix. Transfer to a work surface and knead for 15-20 minutes, until you can stretch the dough to form a thin windowpane without ripping. Slowly mix in the softened butter then return to the mixing bowl. Cover with cling film and prove for 1-2 hours, until doubled in size (time really depends on your room temperature). 

Once doubled in size, punch the air out the dough and separate into 3 dough balls. Roll into a long rectangle, then fold into thirds. Roll into a rectangle again, then roll into a log, pinching at seams. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. Place side by side in a buttered bread/deep loaf tin and prove for 30-45 mins, until nearly filling the tin. 

If baking in an uncovered tin, brush the top with egg wash (the remaining egg yolk with a splash of milk) before baking. Bake at 170°C for 40-45 mins, until cooked through.
