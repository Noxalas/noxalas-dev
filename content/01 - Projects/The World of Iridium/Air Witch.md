Sheltered from birth. Her parents applied her to the [[Academy]] as an honor student (not necessarily to study, but more for the prestige of the scholarship). 

After becoming a [[Witches|witch]] she rebelled against her parents by picking up a less-than-desirable long-term support mission in the outskirts of [[Alterrand]], where her and a group of witches were to offer a helping hand to the local [[Norfolk|norfolk]].
