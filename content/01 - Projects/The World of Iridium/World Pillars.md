World pillars are ancient megastructures that reach high above the clouds, way up into the atmosphere.

Other than getting the [[The Ancients|ancients]] to and from space, they also serve other purposes such as weather control, mana harvest, energy collection, and many more. Many of them are still working today 

Residents of the planet may never find out that these structures are in fact remnants of ancient space elevators. The [[The Ancients|ancients]] have left long before the story of [[Kafestrig]], the world pillars being their attempt at saving the world from themselves. The ancients decided to leave the world, hoping to let the pillars repair the damage they had done.
