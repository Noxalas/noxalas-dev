Mana exists in everything.

[[Nordfolk]] can gather mana and cast spells naturally.

Humans are born with the *ability* to use magic, but their bodies can't handle the iridium buildup as well as other races.

The [[01 - Projects/The World of Iridium/World Pillars|world pillars]] gather mana from the air and crystallize it into different elemental forms in different locations. In a usual setup, four pillars gather different elements through a variety of methods, while in the process also creating [[01 - Projects/Iridium/Iridium (Substance)|Iridium]] as a byproduct. This [[01 - Projects/Iridium/Iridium (Substance)|Iridium]] is gathered in the fifth and largest central pillar.

[[01 - Projects/Iridium/Iridium (Substance)|Iridium]] is a byproduct of manipulating mana. 

It takes time for [[01 - Projects/Iridium/Iridium (Substance)|Iridium]] to go back to being pure mana.

A larger buildup of [[01 - Projects/Iridium/Iridium (Substance)|Iridium]] can eventually become taint that spreads and produces vile blemishes in nature that expend more mana and in the process, create more [[01 - Projects/Iridium/Iridium (Substance)|Iridium]], furthering the process. 

## The races and their iridium purification
