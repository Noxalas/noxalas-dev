[[01 - Projects/Kaffestrig/Kaffestrig]]

A big part of the game is going out on excursions where the witches can gather materials, slay monsters and collect the elemental essence gathered in ancient structures and in nature.

The '[[Elevator|elevator]]', as I'm calling it for now, is dialed to a random position in the world, and can travel there and back a couple of times, making it so the witches do not have to gather everything at once, and if something peculiar comes up, they can regroup at the kafestrig and get the necessary tools to deal with the problem.
