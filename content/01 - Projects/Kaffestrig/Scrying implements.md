All witches learn how to use a scrying implement of some kind, a special tool that lets them identify and inspect objects and living beings, and learn more about them.

Gameplay wise, these would be the in-world explanation for the [[Identification mode]], which is sort of like a 'pause menu' of sorts. A player pauses the game, they get a 'pointer' and can hover over everything, which displays a small tooltip with some info.
