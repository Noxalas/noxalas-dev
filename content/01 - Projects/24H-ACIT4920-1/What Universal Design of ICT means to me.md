To me, it means an accessible way for most individuals to partake in the act of interacting with technology.

I say most, because no solution can be a size-fits-all. Compromises have to be made, but efforts in leveraging the principles of universal design result in technologies that accommodate many more people than if we did not design with our users in mind.
