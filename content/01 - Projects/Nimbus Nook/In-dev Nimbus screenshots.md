By just using this shader on a plane we can easily create water puddles and lakes on islands without too much effort! We can also put collision shapes on a different layer so the camera does not phase through, so we don't have to create a unique filter for when it goes under water.

Head is now a particle system, and the face is always placed on top!
Feet have some IK, but sadly can't get it to work properly so I might scratch it before I go in too deep trying to fix it.

Flight mechanic. Flying expends stamina, unless you are inside a cloud. The clouds fully recharge your stamina bar and shoot you out on the other side of the cloud at Mach speed.

Progress on cloud raymarching shader. Got 3D textures to work, but struggling with the ray origin positioning. Currently, if the camera moves, there is an infinite amount of tiling SDFs rather than just one in the middle.
