Project Nimbus is an exam and bachelor's project where Marti creates a 3D collectathon game with my assistance.

The general idea is that it's going to be either a collectathon or level-based platformer in the style of Mario Odyssey, I'd imagine. Very light emphasis on combat, rather putting the focus on platforming. The character is a cloud that can adapt into different shapes with unique attributes that can help you get through obstacles. 


1. **Title:** "Nimbus Nook" **Setting:** A floating island village in the sky, with fluffy clouds, floating platforms, and mini islands. **Premise:** Nimbus, a young cloudling, has the unique ability to change between different cloud forms. The village's protective wind charm has been stolen, and mischievous sky critters are causing chaos. Nimbus must retrieve the wind charm and bring order back. **Gameplay:**
    
    1. **Cloud Form Change:** Nimbus can change between 3 forms:
        
        - **Cumulus:** Default form, can jump and move.
            
            - **Stratus:** Flat and wide, can glide for short distances.
            - **Cirrus:** Thin and wispy, can fit through tight spaces and avoid detection.

    1. **Basic Combat:** Nimbus can puff up and release a mini thunderbolt to stun enemies. No detailed combat system; more about timing and using the right cloud form.
    2. **Puzzles:** Use Nimbus's forms to navigate the environment. For example, glide over large gaps as Stratus or sneak through tight air vents as Cirrus.
    3. **Sky Critter Bosses:** At specific points, Nimbus confronts a bigger sky critter. Instead of traditional combat, these are pattern-based encounters where Nimbus must dodge, use the environment, and time his attacks.
    
    **Visual Aesthetics:**
    - Soft, pastel color palette.
    - Simple, whimsical designs for Nimbus, critters, and the environment.
    - Floating islands with little huts, windmills, and small waterfalls that pour into the endless sky below.
    
    **Soundtrack:**
    - Calm, airy tunes with wind instruments.
    
    **Unique Features:**
    
    - **Wind Currents:** Certain areas have wind currents that can help Nimbus reach higher places or can pose as challenges that push him off-course.
    - **Cloud Abilities:** As the game progresses, Nimbus can temporarily gain abilities like rain pour (to grow plants or fill containers) or a mini lightning dash.

    "Nimbus Nook" keeps it compact with core mechanics revolving around Nimbus's transformations. The game offers a mix of platforming, basic combat, and environmental puzzles in a dreamy sky village setting.
