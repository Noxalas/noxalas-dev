Hello. My name is Gottfried Zimmermann, and I am a professor from Mobile User Interaction at the Stuttgart Media University in Germany.

My native language is German, but I like to watch movies in English if this is the original language.

When I watch an English movie from DVD I, usually have captions on because it help me to understand the content better.

Especially when actors speak fast, or with an accent.

Also for videos that are part of online learning courses, I like to look at the captions from time to time.

I may have missed something while listening and by looking at the captions I can recap what was said.

On some video platforms, including YouTube, you can scroll forward and backward in the video,

and immediately see the captions at the position you stop.

This is helpful when I'm searching for a particular location which from what was spoken.

Ok, now you know that I am very much in favor of captions,

not only for people who are hard of hearing or deaf, but also for myself.

What are your experiences with captions?
