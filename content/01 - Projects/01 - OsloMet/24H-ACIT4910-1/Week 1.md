**There is no "typical user"**
- Every individual is different
- 1 in 6 people in Norway have a disability

**User diversity - need to consider:**
- Who - User preferences, age, abilities, ICT competence & skills...
- When and where - situations, context
- How - technology, equipment, AT, devices, formats, version

*"We need a society where it is possible for people, with the full range of human difference, to participate and contribute."* - Jutta Treviranus

"All citizens on web" (Norwegian Policy)
- The goal is to get everyone online

**Areas for UD-ICT**:
1. Computers: OS, software
2. Browsers: Function & features
3. Internet: Content and structure on web sites
4. Equipment: Ergonomics (Product design)

*"The power of the Web is in its universality. **Access** by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."* - Tim Berners-Lee, 2001

**The traditional (wrong) approach**
- inclusion in the ICT environment **a problem of accessibility** to systems and services
- accessibility problems **solved with adaptations using AT** for accessing ICT equipment and services
- technology utilized to **give people with activity limitations abilities** they do not have

**Accessibility defintion**
*"extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities can be used by people from a population with the widest range of characteristics and capabilities to achieve a specified goal in a specified context of use"*

**Adaptation = Special solution / modification**
Necessary when UD isn't enough or when UD cannot be conducted.
(See the [[The Accessibility Pyramid|accessibility pyramid]])

**AT (Assistive Technology)**
*"hardware or software added to or connected to a system that increases accessibility for an individual"*

**Web Accessibility**
"**Accessibility** is about designing so that **more people** can use your website **effectively** in **more situations.**" - Shaw Lawton Henry

**Usability**
"The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specific goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use." - Jacob Nielsen, Ben Schneiderman

**Universal Design**
"The design of products and environments to be **usable** by all people, to the greatest extent possible, **without adaptation or specialized design**" - [[Ronald C. Mace]], 1985

**UNs definition of UD**
"The design of products, environments, programmes and services to be **usable by all people, to the greates extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design**"

"Universal design" **shall not exclude assistive devices** for particular groups of persons with disabilities where this is needed.

Accessibility can be attained through specialized solutions, but such solutions might not be consistent with the ideas of UD. UD requires to take persons with disabilities into account when designing the *main solution*.

**Three Dimensions of Inclusive Design** (Jutta Treviranus)

A designer must...
1. Recognize, respect, and design for human uniqueness and variability
2. Use inclusive, open & transparent processes, and co-design with people who have a diversity of perspectives, including people that can't use or have difficulty using the current designs.
3. Realize that they are designing in a complex adaptive system.
