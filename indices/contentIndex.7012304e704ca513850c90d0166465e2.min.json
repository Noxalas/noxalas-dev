{"/":{"title":"Noxalas' Dev Blog","content":"## Description\nA blog where I post updates about my current projects and tutorials, mostly in the [[Godot Engine]].\n\n## About me\nI'm a student studying Interactive Design in Norway. I spend my free time creating art and games, striving to make things that make me happy and that will inspire others to do the same.\n\nI started this blog to document my ventures and to have a place to look back on, to see the eventual progress I have made.","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T19:59:45.504461064Z","tags":[]},"/posts/Hello-world":{"title":"Hello world!","content":"\nMy first post on this blog, and the start of an exciting new adventure!\n\nI've always wanted to start writing, and after keeping up with daily notes consistently in my [[Obsidian]] vault, I decided it was about time to start my dream blog. \n\nThe plan is simple. I will document any and all fun things I discover or learn throughout my development journey, and write about them here. I will most probably share lots of tutorials and how-tos, including scripts, most being in [[GDScript]]. Additionally, I want to use this blog to document my progress working on [[Kaffestrig]], me and my girlfriend's dream game project.\n\nHopefully I will stick to this blog, and if you choose to read it, I hope you get something out of it. \n\nThanks for reading!","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T19:59:45.504461064Z","tags":[]}}
