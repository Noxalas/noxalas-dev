I spend my free time creating art and games, striving to make things that make me happy and that will inspire others to do the same.\n\nI started this blog to document my ventures and to have a place to look back on, to see the eventual progress I have made.","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T12:49:16.650816854Z","tags":[]},"/posts/Hello-world":{"title":"Hello world!","content":"\nMy first post on this blog, and the start of an exciting new adventure!\n\nI've always wanted to start writing, and after keeping up with daily notes consistently in my [[Obsidian]] vault, I decided it was about time to start my dream blog. \n\nThe plan is simple. I will document any and all fun things I discover or learn throughout my development journey, and write about them here. I will most probably share lots of tutorials and how-tos, including scripts, most being in [[GDScript]]. Additionally, I want to use this blog to document my progress working on [[notes/Kaffestrig]], me and my girlfriend's dream game project.\n\nHopefully I will stick to this blog, and if you choose to read it, I hope you get something out of it. \n\nThanks for reading!","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T12:49:16.658817095Z","tags":["post"]},"/posts/Kaffestrig":{"title":"Kaffestrig","content":"\u003e [!warning]\n\u003e This project is still in development.

There you will gather materials, slay monsters and explore unique biomes, eventually coming back to your shop to create things you sell to customers.\n\n\u003e[!info]\n\u003eUnder construction!\n\n## The gameplay\n...","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T12:49:16.658817095Z","tags":["note"]},"/posts/Kaffestrig-Weekly":{"title":"Kaffestrig Weekly","content":"Weekly updates on [[Kaffestrig]]!\n- [[posts/Kaffestrig Weekly 2.md|Kaffestrig Weekly 2]]\n- [[posts/Kaffestrig Weekly 1.md|Kaffestrig Weekly 1]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T12:49:16.658817095Z","tags":["overview"]},"/posts/Kaffestrig-Weekly-1":{"title":"Kaffestrig Weekly -#1","content":"First weekly update on all things Kaffestrig!\nIf you don't know anything about the project, [[posts/Kaffestrig|you can read all about it here.]]\n\n## IK Systems\n![IK Image](/images/ik_stuff.gif)\n*Yes, those are indeed KAG tiles.*\n\nMost of this week was spent learning about and figuring out how to apply IK to my character animations, with varying amounts of success, but in the end I managed to get to a place where I'm happy enough that I can leave the legs be as they are for now.\n\nThe way I'm doing this is by:\n- Using raycasts to place the feet on the ground.\n- Offsetting the rays based on `Actor` movement, making it so we can control how far ahead the step targets are of the body. \n- Spinning the step targets on the feet based on the `Actor`'s movement. ([[Gait Controller]])\n- Tracking the step targets with the actual IK targets, which the [[notes/FABRIK|FABRIK]] nodes are reaching towards.\n\nAll in all, this gives me lots of flexibility and so *so* many different options on how to animate characters, since I've been fairly diligent in splitting all the concerns into smaller components.\n\nNext up I'll be working on the hands, figuring out how to handle animation when a character equips items and weapons, and casts abilities through them.","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T12:49:16.658817095Z","tags":["post","weekly"]},"/posts/Kaffestrig-Weekly-2":{"title":"Kaffestrig Weekly -#2","content":"This week's update is tiny and a bit late because I was quite busy, but I still managed to get a tiny bit of work done!\n\nSadly, through trying to implement hands holding weapons, I found that most of my equipment \u0026 inventory backend needs quite a bit of reworking to give me the functionality I need. Though, I whipped up a small prototype of weapon switching, *and* they're granting their abilities to the player correctly, so that's great! The only problem is some of the wonkiness that comes from how I handle a character's equipment and the actual equipment 'targets' on the body (where it's holding a weapon, for example).\n\nIt's not all bad though! Even though development went on the backburner, I was still thinking of solutions and things the game needs for the MVP. I'll be working more on the game these next couple of weeks, so hopefully there'll be more to show in the next update!","lastmodified":"2023-08-07T12:49:16.658817095Z","tags":["post","weekly"]}}
